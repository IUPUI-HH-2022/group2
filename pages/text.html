					<p>There are many different types of web users out there and each person has their own set of experiences and challenges that they are bringing to the table. Web designers should have these challenges in mind when creating a site. One reason being that, in some areas, there are laws in place to make sites accessible but also, it is just good practice to be accessible for all. Not only do some of these fixes make a site better for people with these specific challenges but they can also be beneficial to all users.</p>
					<p>Some of the different challenges that we are looking at here for text and readability are users with visual difficulties, users with hearing difficulties, users with mobility devices, & users with cognitive disabilities.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Visual Considerations </h2>
					<p>For users with visual difficulties, i.e. low-vision, color-blind, etc., you will want to make sure that you pick typefaces and fonts that are easy to read, pay attention to font size, keep the number of fonts used to a minimum, and adjust your spacing. You will also want to take special care for 'color vision deficiency' (Webaim). Make sure that colors are not the only way to get the message across, use limited colors in your design, make sure there is good contrast.</p>
					<p>One option for accessibility for visual impairment could be to allow users to choose between a few different color schemes. This gives users more freedom to have things set up in a way that works best for them!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Auditory Considerations</h2>
					<p>Users with hearing impairments, including being deaf or simply hard-of-hearing, can struggle with auditory aspects of webpages, including music or videos. If your page is going to include auditory elements at all, be sure to include redundant visual forms of them --- is there music playing? Let them know! Is there a video on the page, especially one that is integral to the content? Include a transcript or closed-captioning.  </p>
