					<p>
						The way a website is organized has a big impact on accessibility.
						With a few simple layout ideas, you can ensure that all users are
						able to access and enjoy your website comfortably.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Consistency is Key</h2>
					<p>
						By keeping key structures in your design consistent, users are able
						to more quickly and easily navigate your site. If you move objects
						around for the sake of interest, you'll be making the user confused,
						frustrated, and forced off your page.
					</p>
					<p>
						For structures such as the navigation bar, don't switch it up. Keep
						it in one location across all pages, and make sure the navbar
						options are uniform as well
					</p>
					<div class="image-group">
						<img
							src="../images/organization-systems-wireframe.png"
							alt="Organization Systems wireframe breaking down elements of a web page"
						/>
					</div>
					<p>
						The page layout should be consistent across the site, as well - if
						the pages differ too much from one another, users may think they've
						left your site!
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Hamburger Menu</h2>
					<p>
						No, we aren't talking about the Big Mac — we are talking about that
						tried and true classic, the Hamburger Navigation Menu. Navigation
						bars, while essential for users to effectively use your site, can
						take up a lot of space on page, particularly on mobile devices such
						as cell phones where screen real estate is at a premium. Enter the
						Hamburger Menu:
					</p>
					<div class="image-group">
						<img src="../images/hamburger-example.png" alt="Hamburger Menu Icon Example" />
					</div>
					<p>
						The hamburger menu is becoming nearly as ubiquitous as the floppy
						disk icon for “Save” or the wireframe basket for “Trash”. By using
						these three horizontal bars in lieu of your navigation bar on
						smaller viewports, the user is cued to click on it, revealing the
						hidden navbar.
					</p>
					<p>
						That having been said, some hamburger menus pose an issue for users
						accessing the web with a screen reader - the screen reader may skip
						over it entirely or interpret it incorrectly, based on your CSS. One
						simple fix can be achieved using aria labels in your CSS. Consider
						adding the following:
					</p>
					<pre>
						<!-- Intentionally indented this way for formatting purposes -->
						<code>
&lt;a=”#menu” id=”menu-toggle” class=”menu-toggle” aria-label=”Open the menu”&gt;
	&lt;i class=”fa fa-bars” aria-hidden=”true”&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;								
					</code>
				</pre>
					<p>
						The aria-label=”Open the menu”> is not visible on the screen and
						does not execute any action, it is only there for the screen reader
						to catch and convey to the user. Additionally, the
						aria-hidden=”true” will hide the icon from the screen reader, as the
						previous aria label makes it redundant and potentially confusing for
						the user.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Label, Label, Label</h2>
					<p>
						The labels you use around the site - including the navbar - should
						keep the casual user in mind. If you're using labels that only
						initiates into your domain will understand, you're turning users
						away at the door. Instead, go into your label strategy with a plan
						rather than off-the-cuff ideas.
					</p>
					<p>
						Labels should clearly indicate the content that follows them -
						whether on a navbar or in your headers. Additionally, labels are not
						an opportunity to reinvent the wheel. Users are comfortable with
						nearly global standards for navbar labels, and if you stray too far
						from this, you'll leave your users confused and fatigued from
						navigating a new system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, as with the Hamburger Menu above, the simple use of
						aria labels in your CSS will allow screen readers to more accurately
						describe your site to users!
					</p>
